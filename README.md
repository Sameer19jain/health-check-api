# health-check-api
This project is for the understanding of how the api rest calls works and how we can generate response of the various api calls.
In this project I used the health-api of the .net core, which i called for 'ok' and returns false, sends mail to the receipents at 'nok'.
This project was to actually understand the various of the api calls and how do they work around, having the calling progress and reading responses.
